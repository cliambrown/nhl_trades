# nhl_trades
https://cliambrown.com/nhl_trades/

An interactive visualization of all NHL trades and signings since the start of the 2005-2006 regular season.

I've only included the bare bones of this project, because this was just one page from my site. If you have any questions about the code or what's missing, please feel free to contact me! https://cliambrown.com/contact/

I also didn't include the PHP script that gets all of the trade data from the database, but it just returns a javascript file that repeatedly calls nhlTrades.addTrade().
